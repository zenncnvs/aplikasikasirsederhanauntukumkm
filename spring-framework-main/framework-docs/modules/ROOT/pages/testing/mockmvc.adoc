:page-section-summary-toc: 1

MockMvc provides support for testing Spring MVC applications. It performs full Spring MVC
request handling but via mock request and response objects instead of a running server.

MockMvc can be used on its own to perform requests and verify responses using Hamcrest or
through `MockMvcTester` which provides a fluent API using AssertJ. It can also be used
through the xref:testing/webtestclient.adoc[WebTestClient] where MockMvc is plugged in as
the server to handle requests. The advantage of using `WebTestClient` is that it provides
you the option of working with higher level objects instead of raw data as well as the
ability to switch to full, end-to-end HTTP tests against a live server and use the same
test API.
