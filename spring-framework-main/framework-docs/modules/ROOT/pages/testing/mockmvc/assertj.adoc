= AssertJ Integration
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The AssertJ integration builds on top of plain `MockMvc` with several differences:

* There is no need to use static imports as both the requests and assertions can be
crafted using a fluent API.
* Unresolved exceptions are handled consistently so that your tests do not need to
throw (or catch) `Exception`.
* By default, the result to assert is complete whether the processing is asynchronous
or not. In other words, there is no need for special handling for Async requests.

`MockMvcTester` is the entry point for the AssertJ support. It allows to craft the
request and return a result that is AssertJ compatible so that it can be wrapped in
a standard `assertThat()` method.
