= Interception

xref:web/websocket/stomp/application-context-events.adoc[Events] provide notifications for the lifecycle
of a STOMP connection but not for every client message. Applications can also register a
`ChannelInterceptor` to intercept any message and in any part of the processing chain.
The following example shows how to intercept inbound messages from clients:

include-code::./WebSocketConfiguration[tag=snippet,indent=0]

A custom `ChannelInterceptor` can use `StompHeaderAccessor` or `SimpMessageHeaderAccessor`
to access information about the message, as the following example shows:

include-code::./MyChannelInterceptor[tag=snippet,indent=0]

Applications can also implement `ExecutorChannelInterceptor`, which is a sub-interface
of `ChannelInterceptor` with callbacks in the thread in which the messages are handled.
While a `ChannelInterceptor` is invoked once for each message sent to a channel, the
`ExecutorChannelInterceptor` provides hooks in the thread of each `MessageHandler`
subscribed to messages from the channel.

Note that, as with the `SessionDisconnectEvent` described earlier, a DISCONNECT message
can be from the client or it can also be automatically generated when
the WebSocket session is closed. In some cases, an interceptor may intercept this
message more than once for each session. Components should be idempotent with regard to
multiple disconnect events.
