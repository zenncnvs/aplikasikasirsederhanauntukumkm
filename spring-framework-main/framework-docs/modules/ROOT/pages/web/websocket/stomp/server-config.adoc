= WebSocket Transport

This section explains how to configure the underlying WebSocket server transport.

For Jakarta WebSocket servers, add a `ServletServerContainerFactoryBean` to your
configuration. For examples, see
xref:web/websocket/server.adoc#websocket-server-runtime-configuration[Configuring the Server]
under the WebSocket section.

For Jetty WebSocket servers, customize the `JettyRequestUpgradeStrategy` as follows:

include-code::./JettyWebSocketConfiguration[tag=snippet,indent=0]

In addition to WebSocket server properties, there are also STOMP WebSocket transport properties
to customize as follows:

include-code::./WebSocketConfiguration[tag=snippet,indent=0]
