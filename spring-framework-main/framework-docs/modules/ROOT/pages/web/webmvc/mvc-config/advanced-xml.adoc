= Advanced XML Config

The MVC namespace does not have an advanced mode. If you need to customize a property on
a bean that you cannot change otherwise, you can use the `BeanPostProcessor` lifecycle
hook of the Spring `ApplicationContext`, as the following example shows:

include-code::./MyPostProcessor[tag=snippet,indent=0]

Note that you need to declare `MyPostProcessor` as a bean, either explicitly in XML or
by letting it be detected through a `<component-scan/>` declaration.
