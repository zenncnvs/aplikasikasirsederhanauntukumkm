In Java configuration, you can implement the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface, as the
following example shows:

include-code::./WebConfiguration[tag=snippet,indent=0]

In XML, you can check attributes and sub-elements of `<mvc:annotation-driven/>`. You can
view the https://schema.spring.io/mvc/spring-mvc.xsd[Spring MVC XML schema] or use
the code completion feature of your IDE to discover what attributes and
sub-elements are available.
